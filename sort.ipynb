    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n",

    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. Start at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "2. Compare the first two elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.\n",
    "3. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swap.\n",
    "4. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list.\n",
    "5. Repeat the entire process until no swaps are needed (the list is sorted).\n",
